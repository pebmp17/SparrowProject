      The Ionic Conference is a one-day conference featuring talks from the
      Ionic team. It is focused on Ionic applications being built with
      Ionic 2. This includes migrating apps from Ionic 1 to Ionic 2,
      Angular concepts, Webpack, Sass, and many other technologies used
      in Ionic 2. Tickets are completely sold out, and we’re expecting
      more than 1000 developers – making this the largest Ionic
      conference ever!
